                    <h1>Happy Valentine's Day Sweetheart!!</h1>
                    <h2>
                        Honey, this is one of the messages I’ve created for you, 
                        and I am certain it will touch your heart. 
                        It has been almost two months since we began our journey together. 
                        Whatever I have gone through with you, I will never regret it. 
                        Every problem and every obstacle has only allowed us to know each other more deeply. 
                        I don’t think I’ll ever find someone like you in anyone else.
                        My heart feels tight just imagining a time where we are no longer connected,
                        no longer sharing news, no longer encouraging one another. 
                        Let my loyalty be my test. 
                        I will ensure that you receive all the love and faithfulness I have to give. 
                        I will reassure you that I will never look elsewhere. 
                        I truly hope that we will return to the same home, enjoy meals together, and live under the same roof. 
                        I feel those things are more worth thinking about and fighting for 
                        than constantly fearing the loss of you.
                        Honey, I wrote this as a way to express my feelings and how much I love you beyond just my words. 
                        Aside from this, I will continue to immortalize our moments, 
                        my feelings for you, and the story of our journey through every ability I have.
                    </h2>
                    <h3>From the depths of my being, <br> I love you with all my heart. <br> oooooooooooooo</h3>
